<p>Mar Vista High School, part of Sweetwater School District, is located in Imperial Beach, CA and was established 67 years ago. The community of Imperial Beach is a tight-knit one, and Mar Vista High School is an important thread in that fabric.</p>

<p>Mar Vista has certain specialized tracts that their students can follow to cultivate their interest in a specific field. Unique to Mar Vista High is their award-winning <a href="https://mvh.sweetwaterschools.org/poseidon-academy/">Poseidon Academy Program</a>, which fits in well with its beach community. <a href="/blog/practitioner-spotlight-mario-olmos">Silver Strand Physical Therapy’s very own Mario Olmos</a> is a teacher who plays a large role in the Poseidon Academy. Also, Mar Vista High has started a Sports Medicine tract, and there are hopes to have these students assist during sporting events/games and help manage injuries.</p>

<p><a href="/">Silver Strand Physical Therapy</a> has been fortunate enough to work with some of Mar Vista High’s athletic teams, including baseball and football. Mar Vista High’s Athletic Director and football coach, Tyler Arciaga, is very passionate about school athletics and keeping his athletes healthy encouraging them to seek injury prevention screens in our clinic.</p>

<p>The beloved football season is still months away, but the spring season is just getting started, so be sure to check the calendar to catch a baseball or softball game, swim meet, or any of the other exciting sporting events that Mar Vista has to offer.</p>
