I"û<p>Itâ€™s 2018 and if your insurance coverage is even <em>more</em> confusing, have no fear because weâ€™re here to help. At <a href="/">Silver Strand Physical Therapy</a> we are the local experts in insurance coverage, benefits, and <a href="/services">physical therapy for TRICARE</a> families. Weâ€™ve compiled a list of FAQâ€™s related to your health insurance coverage.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-all-the-names-associated-with-tricare">What are all the names associated with TRICARE?</h3>

<p>In 2017 and prior you may have seen names such as Optum or United Health Care associated with you benefits. These were the companies that managed the military health care plans. As of 2018, these names have changed and become somewhat confusing for families. But donâ€™t fear, weâ€™re here to ease your mind. From January 1st, 2018 and moving forward you will now see your benefits show up as HealthNet TRICARE. HealthNet is now the managing insurance body that will handle all of your healthcare needs.</p>

<h3 id="who-is-covered-under-tricare">Who is covered under TRICARE?</h3>

<p>Active military members, non-active military members, spouses, and family members are all covered under various TRICARE plans.</p>

<h3 id="who-can-i-go-see-for-my-healthcare-needs">Who can I go see for my healthcare needs?</h3>

<p>Active military members have access to healthcare (such as primary care doctors or physical therapy) either on base or at a contracted HealthNet TRICARE provider off base. To learn more about how to access off base physical therapy check out our blog for active military members here (insert link to other article for active military).</p>

<p>Non-active military members, along with spouses and family members of active and non-active military members are more likely to receive care off base for their physical therapy needs.
