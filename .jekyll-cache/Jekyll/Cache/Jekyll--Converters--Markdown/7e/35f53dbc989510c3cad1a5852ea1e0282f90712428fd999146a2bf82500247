<p>Gina’s experience as a Navy Spouse while working at our clinic makes her a great person to call and ask about your <a href="/insurance">Tricare coverage</a>. This includes inquires about the new Tricare Waiver. Did you know under this waiver, active duty patients can be seen for <a href="/">physical therapy treatment</a> as soon as the next day? You can also call and ask about coverage for other insurances. As she’s also a patient, Gina can give you the inside scoop on what our clinic can do to get you back to full health!</p>
