Gina’s experience as a Navy Spouse while working at our clinic makes her a great person to call and ask about your [Tricare coverage](/insurance). This includes inquires about the new Tricare Waiver. Did you know under this waiver, active duty patients can be seen for [physical therapy treatment](/) as soon as the next day? You can also call and ask about coverage for other insurances. As she’s also a patient, Gina can give you the inside scoop on what our clinic can do to get you back to full health!
