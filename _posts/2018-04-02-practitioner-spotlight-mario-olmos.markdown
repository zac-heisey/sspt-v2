Hello, my name is Mario Olmos and I am the acupuncturist at [Silver Strand Physical Therapy](/). Growing up, I loved science, sports, and the outdoors. In 1984 I graduated from Cal Poly, Pomona with a B.S. in biological sciences. In 1989 I attended San Diego State University, where I received my high school science teaching credential. In 1995 I started the Poseidon Academy of Marine Science at Mar Vista High School. Through my work with the students in the Poseidon Academy, I've been able to work with many community leaders and have established many professional partnerships. I have been teaching, coaching, and practicing acupuncture in Imperial Beach for over 20 years.

I graduated with my masters in acupuncture from Pacific College of Oriental Medicine in San Diego in 2003. Soon thereafter, I worked at the [Samahan Clinic](https://www.operationsamahan.org/) in National City where I provided low cost acupuncture to many elderly and minority patients. From 2005 to 2008, I was able to hone my skills in sports medicine, orthopedic rehabilitation, and neuro-acupuncture at the [Sage Traditions Acupuncture clinic](https://ibhealing.today/) in Imperial Beach. 

Throughout my fourteen years of practice, I have been able to work with many types of athletes, including wrestlers, football players and track and field stars. In 2017 I was asked to be the team doctor for the Mater Dei Catholic wrestling team. I worked closely with the trainer, got to travel with the team and was able to treat many of the young athletes. In September of that year, Dr. Navid Hannanvash gave me the opportunity to join the team at Silver Strand Physical Therapy.  I am happy to be able to offer quality acupuncture, sports medicine and [neuro-acupuncture](http://neuro-acupuncture.org/) to the citizens of the South Bay in a warm, friendly, and professional atmosphere.
