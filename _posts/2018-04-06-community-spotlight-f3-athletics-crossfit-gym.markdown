Tucked away on Silver Strand Boulevard you'll find Imperial Beach’s very own CrossFit gym, Form Follows Function Athletics, or [F3 Athletics](https://www.athleticsf3.com) for short. The name says it all - the coaches place a heavy emphasis on form to improve upon your body’s functional capabilities. The team is welcoming to both newcomers and experienced crossfitters alike, and is known in the community for offering a wide array of information, classes, clinics, and even occasional community gatherings.

Daniel Rios is co-owner of F3 Athletics. He has a degree in Exercise Science and a passion for fitness. Daniel specializes in Olympic weightlifting, powerlifting, and strongman training. He is just one of the team members you can find in the gym helping clients on a daily basis. When speaking with Daniel, it's clear that life-long health and wellness, as well as strength, are his primary goal. He says, "Our gym is a coaching facility to help people through nutrition and exercise principals that lead to long-term, habit-based results."
