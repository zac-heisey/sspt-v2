## 1-on-1 Physical Therapy in Imperial Beach & South San Diego

Silver Strand Physical Therapy is a hybrid physical therapy clinic combining traditional physical therapy tools and approaches with Applied Functional Science (AFS) to provide patients with the most comprehensive approach to their care.

Applied Functional Science uses a total body approach to not only treat the patientâ€™s symptoms, but to find the underlying source of their issues. Using the most authentic positioning and input to the body allows our clinicians to set the body up for success moving forward.

Silver Strand Physical Therapy is located in the heart of Imperial Beach, making us the physical therapy clinic of choice for patients throughout the South Bay.
