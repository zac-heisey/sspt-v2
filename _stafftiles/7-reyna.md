Reyna Bucknell earned her Doctorate in Physical Therapy from the University of St. Augustine. She specializes in Orthopedics and enjoys working with patients of all ages. She also focuses on Pelvic Floor Rehabilitation and is working on completing the extensive certification process. Reyna is originally from New Orleans, but she grew up in Venezuela where she became fluent in Spanish. She enjoys traveling to new places, learning new and better techniques for treating her patients, doing yoga and spending time with her family. She has always had a passion for helping others. She underwent physical therapy herself in 2007, which inspired her to attain her doctorate so she can help other people achieve their physical goals and get back to the lives they enjoy living.
