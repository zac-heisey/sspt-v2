**Project Description:** This is a sample project page. You can add more projects in the `_projects` directory of your Jekyll build. Be sure to include the proper [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) for each of your projects, including your project's `title`, applicable `categories`, and a `featured-image`.
