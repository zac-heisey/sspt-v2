Non-combat injury is common in the military, and many injuries are sustained during required rigorous training programs. Recent studies suggest that these injuries are often from a combination of training as well as equipment and footwear utilized in different branches of the military `1`. While we cannot change the uniform or the equipment, what we can do is to understand common injuries and how to prepare and pre-train for prevention.

Let’s start with training requirements: Depending on the branch of the military you enlist, you can expect to perform:

* Timed 1.5-3 mile runs

* Timed sit ups

* Timed push ups

* Pull ups

Many of these injuries sustained during training tend to be “overuse” injuries such as tendonitis and sprains. This is often the result of repetitive activity, especially when these activities are new activities to us.

A list of common training injuries includes:

* Plantar fasciitis

* ITB syndrome

* Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome

* Medial Tibial Stress Syndrome (Shin Splints)

* Achilles Tendonitis
